## Features
- Fail Fast -> Stops when a test fails
- Sleeps 1 second after every test for cleanups (DB, API, ...)
- Prints individual test time
- Prints total test time

## Requirements
- One folder for every test file
- Every test file needs to end with 'test'
- Every test file only should have one test method! (Keeps sequential order)

## Commands
```sh
# default test dir: testsE2E
goe2e

# run with custom test dir
goe2e --dir customTesting
goe2e -d customTesting
```

## Why?
- Go Unit Tests run in parallel by default and do not have a sleep between them
- Some E2E needs to run sequentially and with a sleep between them for cleanups!
- E.g. DB E2E which runs on the same DB but manipulates the same tables
- This can cause test failures if every DB E2E test assumes a clean table
- Even worse it can succeed sometimes and fail otherwise!
- Solution = Run every test in sequence and introduce a default sleep
- It is slower than parallel execution but provides test stability!
