## Features
- Fail Fast -> Stops when a test fails
- Sleeps 1 second after every test for cleanups (DB, API, ...)
- Prints individual test time
- Prints total test time

## Requirements
- One folder for every test file
- Every test file needs to end with 'test'
- Every test file only should have one test method! (Keeps sequential order)

## Commands
```sh
# default test dir: testingE2E
goseq

# run with custom test dir
goseq --dir customTesting
goseq -d customTesting
```

## Why?
- Go Unit Tests can run in parallel
- Some E2E needs to run sequentially!
- E.g. DB E2E which runs on the same DB but manipulates the same tables
- This can cause test failures if every DB E2E test assumes a clean table
- Even worse it can succeed sometimes and fail otherwise!
- Solution = Run every test in sequence
- It is slower than parallel execution but provides test stability
